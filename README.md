# 2-player-Sticks-card-game
javafx gui of the card game Sticks

This is a javafx implementation of a card game called Sticks. This program was created from a final class project assignment by professor Tracy Dobbs, which some code and files are derived from him. The rules in which this program works are not based  entirely on the original Sticks rules, but were for the scope of the class.

Getting Started:
// IMPORTANT
-this program was written with files on macos, is you are using windows you'll have to change the fileinputstream to a windows format. code to format is for both player1(lines 273-297) and player2(lines 452-476). 

-This code was written in JAVA SE 8, but not sure if that matters in this case.
-All files must stay within the same java project, when you download the cards files and .java files they all must stay in the single project.
-the cards file contains images of a standard deck of 52 cards, 52 images
-backofcard.png, emptyspace.png, and aceofhearts.png are png images used for displaying a back of a card and simulate an empty space.
-make sure java.fx is working before launch.

Testing:
-when the program launchs, you can check the behaviors of the gui in your ide while it's running. for example checking the goals while you draw and discard cards.

Deployment:
-this program will create a window upon launch that will allow you to play the game.

Contributing:
-developers are welcome to work on and fix bugs/improve this program as long as it follows the contributing code of conduct, which you can find here. https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426

Known Bugs:
-although the program will run, and allow two people to play the game, there are a couple bugs at time of posting:
  -duplicate cards can show when drawing/discarding
  -able to just click "draw" without ever having to click the "discard" button
  -sometimes game won't declare winner despite player reaching goal.
